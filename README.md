# accessible-scrollbars

## browsers

To be used with an extension such as [Stylus](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?pli=1) or [User Javascript or CSS](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld).

## vscode

1. Install [Custom CSS and JS Loader](https://marketplace.cursorapi.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css) and [Fix VSCode Checksums Next](https://marketplace.cursorapi.com/items?itemName=RimuruChan.vscode-fix-checksums-next).
2. Following the instructions of these extensions, point to `styles.css` in some manner, then fix the VS Code checksums. The latter is to retain the security mechanism that VS Code offers.

The only scrollbar I'm aware of that this doesn't work with is the one for the editor. I don't mind because I'm using the minimap anyway but if somebody finds a solution, please submit a PR.
